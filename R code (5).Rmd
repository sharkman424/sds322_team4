## Importing file and libraries

First we will read the file, import the tidyverse library to manipulate the dataset and reticulate to be able to play with python as well. First we are going to drop the columns X and X.1

```{r}

library(tidyverse) 
library(reticulate) 

use_python("/usr/bin/python3", required = F)

# do not touch these settings
Sys.which("python")
Sys.getenv("DISPLAY") 

matplotlib <- import("matplotlib", convert = TRUE)
matplotlib$use("Agg")

install.packages("gridExtra")
library("gridExtra")

```


```{r}

#First we read the file

data <- read.csv("ENB2012_data (2).csv")

#When the file is loaded, two empty columns appear, which we now drop from the dataset. Then we make sure that there are no missing values in the data.

data %>% select(-X, -X.1) %>% na.omit() -> data

#Here we are re-labeling the column names to make them more intuitive

data <- data %>% select(relative_compactness = 'X1', surface_area = 'X2', wall_area = 'X3', roof_area = 'X4', overall_height = 'X5', orientation = 'X6', glazing_area = 'X7', glazing_area_distribution = 'X8', heating_load = 'Y1', cooling_load = 'Y2')

#Here we are converting glazing are distribution (which is categorical with no natural order) into several dummy variables

data1 <- data %>% mutate(glazing_area_distribution1 = ifelse(glazing_area_distribution == 1,1,0), glazing_area_distribution2 = ifelse(glazing_area_distribution == 2,1,0),glazing_area_distribution3 = ifelse(glazing_area_distribution == 3,1,0), glazing_area_distribution4 = ifelse(glazing_area_distribution == 4,1,0), glazing_area_distribution5 = ifelse(glazing_area_distribution == 4,1,0))

#We do the same for orientation, which is also a categorical variable

data1 <- data1 %>% mutate(orientation2 = ifelse(orientation == 2,1,0), orientation3 = ifelse(orientation == 3,1,0), orientation4 = ifelse(orientation == 4,1,0), orientation5 = ifelse(orientation == 5,1,0))

#Finally, we drop the original orientation and glazing area distribution variables

data1 <- data1 %>% select(-orientation, -glazing_area_distribution)

#We decided not to scale the data since we will be using regression models that don't rely on distances, therefore normalizing it will add no value
```

#From the graphs we can observe that the heating load seems to follow a step function when analyzed against relative compactness and surface area. For relative compactness there seems to be a threshold (of around 0.74), that when surpassed, triggers the heating load to increase. For the surface area, we can infer that when a threshold of around 662 is surpassed, the heating load diminishes. 

#On the other hand, when analyzing heating load against wall area we can observe a slightly positive trend, and when analyzing it against roof area we can evidence what resembles a negative quadratic function. However, none of these trends seem to be very strong so that we can draw conclusions, probably more values would need to be included to be able to do this. 

#Overall height seems to have a great impact on the response variable. A higher height seems to be related with a high heating load. 

#Finally, orientation, glazing area and glazing area distribution seem to have little or no effect on the heating load. 

#The same conclusions can be applied to the cooling load.

#We can draw several conclusions from the correlation matrix. 

# First, the variables that seem to be highly positively correlated to heating and cooling load are overall height, relative compactness. On the other hand, roof area and surface are seem to be highly negatively correlated to them.

#The correlation between cooling and heating load is of 98%, which supports our hypothesis obtained above that the distribution of the response variables seems to be practically identical. 

#Finally, there is a high correlation between all numerical explanatory variables except for wall area, which might suggest that the setup of the experiment could be improved.
