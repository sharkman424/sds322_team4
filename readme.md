# Short Description

Assess the heating / cooling load requirements of buildings as a
function of various building requirements

Conduct a regression analysis to predict the heating / cooling load
requirements of buildings based on building parameters such as glazing
area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst
others.

# Project Goals

Visualize the data set of building requirements and heating / cooling
load requirements and construct some hypotheses based on the
visualization

Train and test a predictive model for the dataset using a target
variable and assess the performance of the model

# Information About The Data

The dataset contains information about the heating loads and cooling
load requirements for buildings with different attributes (the variables
are relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall
height, orientation, glazing area and glazing area distribution). There
are 768 observations (rows) of data across 8 different attributes
(columns), aiming to predict two real valued responses.
