# Short Description

We want to assess the heating and cooling load of buildings as a function of various building parameters.
We will conduct a regression analysis to predict the heating and cooling load of buildings in order to identify which building parameters influence them the most.


# Project Goals

Visualize the data set of building requirements and heating / cooling
load requirements and construct some hypotheses based on the
visualization

Train and test a predictive model for the dataset using a target
variable and assess the performance of the model

Determine which building parameters have the most influence on heating/cooling load, so we can use that insight to design buildings to be more energy-efficient.

# Information About The Data

The dataset was generated from simulations run using the Ecotect software. The simulations used 12 different Ecotect building shapes under various parameter combinations to generate 768 buildings. The dataset has 8  features, which are the building parameters that we will use to predict the response variables, which are the heating and cooling loads of the buildings. These features include Relative Compactness, Surface Area, Wall Area, Roof Area, Overall Height, Orientation, Glazing Area, and Glazing Area Distribution.
